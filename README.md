Classes representing notes (e.g. Bear / Evernote). Each note consists of title and text, can be locked to avoid deletion/modification and is part of a collection specified with a name. It can also be part of a collection of important notes as well as a specific collection. Use Observer to remove automatically a Note from a Collection when the Note is deleted by itself.
